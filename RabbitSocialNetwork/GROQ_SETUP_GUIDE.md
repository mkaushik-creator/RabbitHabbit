- âœ… **Ultra-fast** - 10x faster than competitors
- âœ… **High-quality** - Llama 3.3 70B model

## Pro Tip: Use Both!
You can add both `GROQ_API_KEY` and `HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN` to your secrets. The app will use Groq first (fastest), then fall back to Hugging Face if needed. This gives you the best reliability!

## Next Steps

1. **Get your Groq API key** from https://console.groq.com
2. **Add it to Replit Secrets** as `GROQ_API_KEY`
3. **Restart your app** - Groq will automatically become active
4. **Test the AI features** - Content generation and chat will be much faster!

## Need Help?

If you have any issues:
1. Check that your API key is correctly added to secrets
2. Verify the key starts with `gsk_`
3. Restart the Replit app after adding the secret
4. Check the console logs for any error messages

The integration is production-ready and will handle errors gracefully, falling back to other providers if needed.
