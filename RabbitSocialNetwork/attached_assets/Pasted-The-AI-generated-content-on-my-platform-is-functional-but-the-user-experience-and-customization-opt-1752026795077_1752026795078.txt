The AI-generated content on my platform is functional, but the user experience and customization options are currently limited. I want to make the following enhancements to improve usability and relevance:

1. **Output Format Options**  
   Add a formatting selector above the AI output that allows users to choose their preferred style:
   - [ ] Paragraph  
   - [ ] Poetic  
   - [ ] Bullet-style  
   - [ ] Concise/Snappy  
   - [ ] Story-style

2. **Emoji Toggle**  
   Include a toggle switch that lets users turn emojis ON or OFF before generating content. The current output always includes emojis, which may not suit all users.

3. **Hashtag Suggestions**  
   Automatically suggest 2–3 hashtags relevant to the user’s prompt and platform (e.g. #unexpectedvisitor #tinycreature for Instagram or X). Show these separately under the post preview.

4. **Non-Repetitive Sentence Openings**  
   Currently, all platform outputs start similarly ("I sat frozen", "As I sat", etc.). Add randomization to the opening sentence to avoid repetition and make each platform’s version feel unique.

5. **Tone & Niche Personalization**  
   Let users select their preferred:
   - Niche: (e.g. Writer, Tech Reviewer, Food Blogger, Travel, Fitness, etc.)
   - Tone: (e.g. Witty, Calm, Professional, Friendly, Minimalist)

   Use this selection to guide how content is generated for different platforms.

6. **Inline Text Editing + Smart Rewriting Options**  
   Enable users to:
   - Click on any part of the AI text and request quick actions like:  
     “Make this funnier”, “Simplify this”, “Make it more emotional”, or “Shorten it”
   - This would help them fine-tune results without fully regenerating everything.

7. **Intro Line Shuffle Button**  
   Add a button that allows users to shuffle the **first sentence only** of the generated content. This helps them vary tone quickly without losing the rest of the text.

8. **User Prompt Assistance (Optional)**  
   Add a helper that suggests improvements to vague user inputs. For example, if a user types “i was sitting on a chair and a mouse came in,” the app can suggest:  
   “Would you like to describe the emotion (e.g. surprised, scared)?” or  
   “Should the story be poetic or humorous?”

These features will significantly enhance the creative control and experience for users generating content for different platforms. Please implement the features step-by-step or modularly depending on feasibility.
