Create a modern, responsive, and user-friendly UI for connecting social media platforms. The interface should include the following elements and enhancements:

1. **Layout & Structure**
   - Display each platform in a card-style layout (Instagram, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, TikTok, Facebook, YouTube Shorts).
   - Each card should have:
     - Platform icon
     - Platform name
     - Checkbox to select
     - A “Connect” button (or “Connected” indicator if already connected)
     - Optional mini-preview for connected platforms (e.g. profile name, follower count)

2. **Design Theme**
   - Include both dark and light themes.
   - Add a toggle switch at the top-right to switch between themes.

3. **Platform Styling**
   - Apply subtle background colors or accents based on each platform’s brand colors:
     - Instagram: gradient border or tint
     - Twitter/X: light blue/black
     - LinkedIn: light blue
     - TikTok: dark gray/pink
     - Facebook: blue
     - YouTube Shorts: soft red

4. **Interactions**
   - Add hover effects to cards and buttons:
     - Slight lift (`scale(1.02)`)
     - Shadow on hover
     - Button hover glow
   - Animate checkbox tick with smooth transition.

5. **Smart Selection**
   - Add a “Select All Platforms” checkbox at the top.
   - Ticking it selects all available platforms.

6. **Status Indicators**
   - For connected platforms:
     - Change button to green “✅ Connected”
     - Display green dot or check icon
     - Optional: Tooltip with timestamp (e.g., “Connected at 3:15 PM”)
   - Add red/gray icons for failed/pending status (optional).

7. **Responsive Design**
   - Ensure the layout adapts for mobile:
     - Cards stack vertically
     - Touch-friendly spacing and large icons
     - Buttons become full-width if needed

8. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure high color contrast
   - Support keyboard navigation
   - Use `aria-labels` for buttons and checkboxes

9. **Optional Advanced View**
   - Add a toggle to switch to “Minimal Mode” showing only platform icons and connection chips (for power users)

10. **Styling Framework**
   - Use Tailwind CSS or standard CSS-in-JS (if preferred)
   - Use consistent spacing, rounded corners (`rounded-xl`), and soft shadows

Generate this UI with clean, production-ready HTML/CSS/JS (or React if preferred) using best practices.
